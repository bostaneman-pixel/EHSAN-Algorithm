# EHSAN Optimizer v1.0

EHSAN Optimizer is a physics‑inspired optimization algorithm derived from a simple continuous model of collective motion and energy minimization.  
Despite its minimal design, the algorithm shows **strong, stable, and competitive performance** on a wide range of **smooth and continuous optimization problems**.

This repository contains the reference implementation of **EHSAN Optimizer v1.0**, along with benchmark functions, examples, and reproducible experiments.
