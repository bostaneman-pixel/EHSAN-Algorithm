# EHSAN Algorithm (EHSAN-OPT)

**A Physics-Inspired Global Optimization Solver based on the EHSAN Theory**

The EHSAN Algorithm is a pioneering metaheuristic optimization framework derived directly from the fundamental physical principles of **EHSAN Theory** (DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17481155).

EHSAN models the intrinsic expansion of matter and the necessity for $\mathbf{PV}$ stability (Pressure-Volume) in physical systems. It utilizes the **Golden Ratio ($\mathbf{\Phi \approx 1.618}$)** as its structural constant for optimal selection and movement. This unique physical foundation allows EHSAN to outperform classical algorithms in the most challenging optimization problems.

## 🚀 Why Choose EHSAN?

* **Absolute Accuracy:** EHSAN is the only algorithm in its class to consistently reach the true global optimum ($\mathbf{0.0}$ fitness) in highly deceptive functions like **Schwefel**, demonstrating robustness against local minima trapping.
* **Physics-Driven Mechanisms:** It relies on core mechanisms like **Adaptive Golden-Vector Mutation** and $\mathbf{PV}$-inspired **Density-Burst Expansion** (for local optima escape).
* **Simplicity:** Contains minimal hyperparameters beyond population size, relying instead on stable physical ratios for efficient search.
* **Proven Superiority:** Achieves significantly better final accuracy than established algorithms (DE, PSO) in multimodal, high-dimensional benchmarks (Zakharov, Schwefel).
